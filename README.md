# good-bye-world

As this something new to me and I really don't have any idea of what I'm doing.. I'll leave the "Description" section.. EMPTY..

Following the tutorial that Github.com has made for idiots like me, that they tought that learning to code will be easy, I got to the point where they "sugested" me to say something about myself.. but they don't know that people like me, they don't like to talk about themself?.. I mean.. what can I say? that I'am arrogant, egocentrist, narcisistic bastard?.. I don't want to say that.. so I won't say anything about me.. for now..
