Doing something that I haven't learned how to do yet.. 
This will be fun..

# The never ever dying "Hello World".

print("Hello World")

# print is the name of the function. The function tells Python, what we want to do (in this case, to print some text)
# quotes are used to surround strings (ALWAYS), we can use either single or double quotes for strings
print("hello world")
print('hello world')

#if we do want to include quotes in the output, the easiest thing to do is use the other type of quotes for surrounding the strings
print('she said "hello world"')
print("he said 'hello world'")

#another things.. this #(hash) that I'm using (a lot).. they are not for posting on social media later.. we use hash(#) when we make comments.
#to include a comment in your source code, start the line with a hash(#) symbol and the computer will ignore that line.

#somthing that I already hate: error messages and debugging
#computer programs never works correctly the first time
#forgetting quotes
#Syntaxerror: invalid syntax.. already hate it
print(hello world)
#misspell the function
#syntaxerror: invalid syntax
prin("hello world")
